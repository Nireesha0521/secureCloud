# 🔒 SecureCloud: Encrypted File Storage and Sharing Platform

## 📘 Project Overview
**SecureCloud** is an academic **team project** developed as part of the Computer Science and Engineering curriculum at *Chaitanya Engineering College (2025)*.  
The project focuses on building a secure platform for **file storage and sharing** using **Java and MySQL**, integrating **AES encryption** for confidentiality and **token-based authentication** for controlled file access.

The application allows users to **upload, encrypt, search, and share files** securely with role-based authentication and keyword-based retrieval.  
The project was developed collaboratively by a 3-member team. My individual contribution centered on backend development and database design.

## 🎯 Objectives
- To design and implement a **Java-based backend system** for secure file handling.  
- To apply **AES encryption** for protecting file data during upload and retrieval.  
- To develop **user authentication and token-sharing mechanisms** for access control.  
- To explore practical applications of **database connectivity, exception handling, and data security** in Java.

## 👩‍💻 My Role
- **Role:** Backend Developer & Database Designer  
- **Responsibilities:**
  - Developed backend modules using **Java (JDBC)** for secure file management and database communication.  
  - Implemented **AES encryption** logic for file upload and decryption processes.  
  - Designed and optimized **MySQL database schema** for user authentication and access tracking.  
  - Integrated **token-based file sharing** to enhance security and control.  
  - Performed unit testing and debugging for backend operations.  
  - Contributed to project documentation and technical reporting.

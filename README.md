# SecureCloud: Encrypted File Storage and Sharing Platform

## Project Overview

SecureCloud is a full stack web application designed for secure file storage and sharing. I developed this project using AI assistance to bring my vision to life, defining the project idea, specifying requirements, identifying issues, and ensuring the application met its goals. The platform allows users to upload, encrypt, and share files securely, with features like user authentication, keyword-based search, and token-based file sharing. Iâ€™m currently studying the code to learn the technologies involved and build my coding skills.

This project demonstrates my ability to conceptualize a tech solution, manage its development, and understand full stack development concepts. It also serves as a learning tool as I work towards becoming a full stack developer.

## Features

- *User Authentication*: Register, login, and reset passwords securely with email notifications.
- *File Upload and Encryption*: Upload files with a custom filename and keyword; files are encrypted using AES encryption for security.
- *Keyword-Based Search*: Search for files using a keyword to retrieve an encrypted key for downloading.
- *Secure File Download*: Download files by providing the correct encrypted key, ensuring only authorized users can access them.
- *File Sharing*: Share files with other users via email, with a unique token for secure access.
- *Responsive UI*: A user-friendly interface with a dashboard, search bar, and sliding profile panel.
- *Deployment*: Deployed on Render with GitHub for version control.
